        <p>Students attending Business Technology Early College High School (BTECH) will learn how to help the world run better using technology to solve everyday world problems. Our students will become expert readers, writers, and critical thinkers with the technical skills to be successful in our modern information-based global economy. Students have up to six years to earn a high school diploma and an associate degree—free of cost—from Queensborough Community College and hands-on job training and apprenticeship with SAP (an international enterprise software development company). Upon graduation, our students will have the knowledge, skills, career and technical education certifications, and work experience that will make our graduates much more competitive for employment and/or four-year colleges.</p>

        <p>Queensborough proudly reflects the unique character of the local Queens community, the most diverse county in the United States. We distinguish ourselves from other higher education institutions in America because of that diversity, with nearly equal populations of African Americans, Asians, Caucasians and Latinos. In fact, our students come from more than 140 countries and speak some 84 different languages.

          More than 16,000 students are currently enrolled in associate degree or certificate programs, and another 10,000 students attend continuing education programs on our campus. Accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education, Queensborough Community College, through its 17 academic departments, offers transfer and degree programs, including Associate in Arts (A.A.), the Associate in Science (A.S.), and the Associate in Applied Science (A.A.S.) degrees. The college also offers non-credit courses and certificate programs.</p>
